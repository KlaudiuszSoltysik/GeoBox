# GeoBox
## About 
GeoBox is my version of a geocaching website. I designed it mobile first so it could be downloaded as a PWA. I put the visual aspects aside and focused on technical aspects.
## Functions
An unregistered user can:    
- sign up (using email, password and nickname) or log in (website is running localy with SQLite database) 
- use remember me button   
- use show password button    
- receive email with token to activate account (token expires after 4h)
- check his coordinates and position on the map (location and map are refreshed automatically)       
- if he uses a browser he can download PWA    
- navigate on the website and use links to other websites   
Additionally, a logged in user can:
- reset password
